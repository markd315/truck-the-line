# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 

## Overview 
This service depends on a mongodb running on port 27017. The docker-compose will launch that but is broken due to a classpath issue.,

See the swagger docs running on http://localhost:8080/truck/swagger-ui.html as well as the included postman collection, and video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TtzVROETV4&feature=youtu.be
